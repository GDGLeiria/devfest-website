And if you put them side by side you can see a lot of similarities between both what will ease switching between one to the other if you have to develop for both platforms. \n \n But what if I told that you could just develop in Kotlin and run it seamlessly on all devices? \n \n Here comes Kotlin Multiplatform!",
